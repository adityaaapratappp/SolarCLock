## ⚙️ Customization

Planet speeds, sizes, colors, and data are all in the `PLANET_DATA` dictionary at the top of the file — easy to tweak:

```python
"Earth": {
    "orb": 155,       # Orbit radius in pixels
    "size": 11,       # Planet radius in pixels
    "col": "#2277FF", # Color
    "spd": 1.00,      # Relative orbital speed
    ...
}
```

To add more stars or shooting stars, change these lines:

```python
self.stars = [Star() for _ in range(650)]      # Increase for denser starfield
self.shooters = [ShootingStar() for _ in range(3)]  # Increase for more shooting stars
```
